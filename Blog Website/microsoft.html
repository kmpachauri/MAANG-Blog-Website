                <p>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington.Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Microsoft was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target="_blank">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen" target="_blank">Paul Allen</a> on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. </p>
             <br>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer" target="_blank">Steve Ballmer</a> replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[8] This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[9] entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella" target="_blank">Satya Nadella</a> took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.[10][11] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also heavily expanded its gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, dedicated to operating Xbox in addition to its three subsidiaries (publishers). Microsoft Gaming is the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue as of 2023.[12]</p>
